# higlass-test-mocks

This repository contains cached mock data used for testing higlass. It provides
a stable set of test fixtures to ensure reliable and reproducible tests without
requiring live API requests.

For more information on how mocks are used in testing, see the [contributing
docs](https://github.com/higlass/higlass/blob/develop/docs/developer.rst) in
the higlass repository.
